Write a function dates_in_month that takes a list of dates and a month (i.e., an int) and returns a list holding the dates from the argument list of dates that are in the month. The returned list should contain dates in the order they were originally given. *)



(* function 5 : dates_in_months
Write a function dates_in_months that takes a list of dates and a list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns a list holding the dates from the argument list of dates that are in any of the months in the list of months. Assume the list of months has no number repeated. Hint: Use your answer to the previous problem and SMLâ€™s list-append operator (@).*)




(* function 6 : Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int n and returns the n th element of the list where the head of the list is 1st.
